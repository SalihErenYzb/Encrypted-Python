# Encrypted-Python
Self Modifying Python file to store passwords, secrets or anything that you want to encrypt. Uses AES encryption to encrypt and decrypt.

# Usage
Double-click the file to launch (requires Python interpreter).
Enter password when prompted:
- First use: Sets encryption key
- Subsequent uses: Decrypts existing data

The application handles package installation automatically and uses your password for encryption/decryption. Data persists between sessions unless manually cleared. To reset everything, delete your data and key by leaving the data field empty; the next launch will be like a fresh start.
